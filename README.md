**About me** ü§ì 

When I was 16, I heard 'server down' and 'maintenance' multiple times when i play MMO games, i wanted to understand what really it mean ? that's when i am acknowledged with terms like network, servers, firewall etc. but really didn't understood much back then, but I always wanted to work with them.

With a wide range of experience in IT sector starting from administration, development and data science I have been playing a key role in the industry for 7+ years where I utilize and apply my knowledge, technical skills which would enable me as a graduate to grow while fulfilling organizational goals.
